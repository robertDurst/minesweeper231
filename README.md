# Minesweeper

I created this game for the final project (the bonus/extension part) for my CS231 class, Data Structures and Algorithms.
The game works like regular minesweeper except that there is no auto-sweep and no flags.
Since there is no auto-sweep, there are just zero blocks for empty spaces, meaning for high scores, you must be smart and have quick
hands. Since there are no flags, you must win by clicking all the bomb empty spaces. There are four bombs, so you win when there are
only four unclicked spaces.

If you want a challenege, try to beat my high score of 24.

Good luck and have fun!
